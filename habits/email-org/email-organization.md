Organizing Emails
=================

**Timeframe:** all the time!


Tips
----

First things first:

- **Keep the inbox empty!** ([GTD][gtd])

  This one is important to stay focused!
  You get distracted from
  all the emails you've processed before,
  spam,
  work that needs to be done, etc.

- Use the DELETE key! ([GTD][gtd])
- Don't check your emails all the time!
  But review action items periodically!
- Don't waste (too much) time to sort emails into a specific folder.
  You will find the email with your client's search functionality.


Preparation
-----------

1. Unsubscribe from newsletters.
   Take some time and check your newsletters and spam to unsubscribe from it,
   typically you can do so at the bottom of these emails.

1. Create 3 folders in your email client:
   - a_ACTION -- The emails that requires action from you. These are "TODOs".
   - a_WAITING -- Emails that needs action from somebody else.
     Check these from time to time and remind somebody to proceed.
   - a_PROCESSED -- The archive. Processed emails (done ones).
     Of course you can have subfolders here for the important ones ;).

1. Move all your emails from the inbox to the archive.

1. Switch off the email sounds and notifications.


Procedure - Handle incoming Emails
----------------------------------

1. Is this email useful?

   No -> DELETE!

   Yes -> next step

1. Does this email needs action?

   No -> ARCHIVE, i.e., move to a_PROCESSED

   Yes -> next step

1. Can I do this under 2 minutes?

   Yes -> DO IT NOW!
   - reply
   - or delegate (move to a_WAITING)
   - or do the required task
   - and finally archive.

   No -> MOVE to a_ACTION
   - set a reminder
   - or check this folder periodically
   - and finally process and archive it

The main challenge is to visit your a_ACTION and a_WAITING emails
periodically to process them.
